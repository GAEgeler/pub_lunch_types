	abstract = {This overview describes the most important designs for single case experimental studies, which are ABAB-design, multiple baseline design, alternating treatments design and changing criterion design. The logic of experimental control in single case studies is explained and it is described, how these different designs are able to provide internal validity and enable causal interpretations of intervention outcome. An important precondition of valid interpretation is objective and reliable data assessment. Data evaluation by visual inspection is explained and several methods of statistical data analysis are discussed. To establish generability across persons, situations, and settings, the importance of replication studies is highlighted.},

	abstract = {Many business and engineering courses stress the use of confidence interval and hypothesis testing procedures based on the Student t distribution. However, students are often unaware of the underlying assumptions that govern these procedures and of the consequences of misapplying them. In this exegetic account, we discuss the concept of robustness by exploring violations of the Student t assumptions and the effects of those violations on the resulting inferences. We also discuss the use of randomization methods as possible alternative methods. Our goal is to familiarize readers with the underpinnings of the t procedures, to summarize their use in practice, and to offer words of caution as to when they should not be used.},
