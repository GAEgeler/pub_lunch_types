# Do meal offer influence our meal choice?
Human actions and decisions in daily life are affected and shaped by «resource cultures», standards, routines and practices that are the fundamental drivers of resource consumption.
To approach resource-light food patterns, the standards, routines and practices affecting and shaping every day actions and decisions around food have to be transformed. 
In this study we focus on models and techniques aiming at directly activating behavioral change. In other words how can canteen guests be persuaded to choose vegetarian or vegan dishes that conserve resources more often due to a changed offer? 
Main result changing the meal offer changes the purchase behavior.
